## Reflection

  - This was a project mainly to understand the main concepts of ReactJs 
  - The idea was to set up an expense tracker application to help in tracking costs.
  - This project was challenging in the sense that understanding some concepts was difficult, for  example how to pass properties from a child component to a parent component and therefore it was a really good learning experience?
  - Some unexpected obstacles include deployment of the project.
  - Tools that i used to implement this project?
      - A React framework was used to come up with this project.
